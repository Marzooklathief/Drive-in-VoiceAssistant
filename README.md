# Drive-in-VoiceAssistant
This is a voice-interactive drive-in assistant application that uses speech recognition, text-to-speech, and the GPT-4 Turbo model to help customers with their orders at a drive-in. The application retrieves the menu from an API and processes voice commands to interact with customers.
## Features
- Speech recognition for understanding customer commands.
- Text-to-speech for interacting with customers.
- Integration with GPT-4 Turbo for handling complex queries.
- Fetches and displays the menu from a specified API.
- Provides item details and handles order placement.
- Calculates and announces the total order amount.
## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech
- `speech_recognition` for recognizing speech
- `requests` for API calls
- `openai` for interacting with the GPT-4 Turbo model
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drive-in-assistant.git
    cd drive-in-assistant
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition requests openai
    ```

## Configuration
